JAVASCRIPT ARRAY METHODS

JavaScript Array Length:

The length property returns the size of an array.
JavaScript Array toString():

The toString() method converts an array to a string of comma-separated values.
Popping (pop()) and Pushing (push()):

Used to remove elements from the end (pop) or add new elements to the end (push) of an array.
Shifting Elements (shift()):

The shift() method removes the first element and shifts others to a lower index.
Unshifting Elements (unshift()):

The unshift() method adds a new element to the beginning, shifting older elements.
Appending with Array Length:

Utilizing the length property provides an easy way to append a new element to an array.
Merging (Concatenating) Arrays (concat()):

The concat() method creates a new array by merging existing arrays.
Flattening an Array:

Flattening is the process of reducing array dimensionality. The flat() method concatenates sub-array elements.
Splicing and Slicing Arrays:

The splice() method adds new items, while slice() method extracts a portion of an array.



FUNCTIONS - MDN WEB DOCS

Definition and Execution:

A JavaScript function is a code block designed for a specific task.
It is executed when invoked or called by "something."
Function Syntax:

Defined with the function keyword, followed by a name and parentheses.
Function names follow variable naming rules.
Parentheses may include parameters (input values).
Code is enclosed in curly brackets.
Return Statement:

When a return statement is reached, the function stops executing.
If invoked from a statement, it returns control to the code after the invoking statement.
Functions often compute and return a value.
Invocation with () Operator:

The () operator invokes or calls the function.
Functions as Variables:

Functions can be used like variables in formulas, assignments, and calculations.


CONTROL FLOW STATEMENTS

If/Else Statements:

Used to execute a block of code based on whether a condition is true or false.
Offers an alternative block of code to execute if the condition is false.
Switch Statements:

Executes a block of code based on the value of a variable or expression.
Loops:

Used to repeat a block of code multiple times based on a condition.
Two main types: for loops and while loops.
While Loops:

Repeats as long as a specified condition is true.
May potentially loop indefinitely.
While and Doâ€¦While Loops:

while loop executes a statement while the condition is true.
do...while loop executes the code first and continues while the condition remains true.



FUNCTIONS - JAVASCRIPT INFO

Purpose:

Functions are fundamental program components, enabling code reuse without repetition.
Syntax:

Declared with the function keyword, followed by a name and parameters in parentheses.
Function body, enclosed in curly braces, contains the executable code.
Function Call:

Executing a function is done by calling it, such as showMessage().
Local Variables:

Variables declared inside a function are only visible within that function's scope.
Parameters:

Parameters allow passing data to functions during their invocation.
Parameters are declared in the function signature, and arguments are values passed during the call.
Default Values:

If a function is called without providing an argument for a parameter, its value becomes undefined.
Returning a Value:

Functions can return a value to the calling code.
Naming Conventions:

Function names are typically verbs, indicating actions.
It's common to use verbal prefixes for function names, providing a brief description of the action.
Functions, with clear names and well-defined purposes, enhance code readability and maintainability.
